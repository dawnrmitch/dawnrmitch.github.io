Hi! My name is Dawn and I'm currently working on a Master's degree in Computer Science part-time while I work full-time at Brandeis University! I did my undergrad in Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago and dabbled in paleontology before starting my Master's. I still have so much to learn, but I love how computer science can be used in almost any field and I am constantly excited about learning all of the things I can create with code. When I'm not working on school or work, I like to play video games, stare at nature, work on new arts and crafts projects, and play piano.
